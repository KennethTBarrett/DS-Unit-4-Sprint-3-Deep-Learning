**Questions:**
- What kinds of regulations do you personally believe need to be put on our industry? Why?

**My Answer:** *I believe foremost we need to be talking about rights to privacy when it comes to topics such as facial recognition and data privacy. This is best done by responsible legislation. The only way this happens in a way that doesn't inherently suppress or even potentially halt the industry is by gaining the public's trust and advocating from within our own community to prevent needlessly overbearing data collection.*

- What policies would you support to improve rights to anonymity while also keeping the benefits things such as CNN's offer?

**My Answer:** *I think the best option we have to preserve the rights granted under the constitution for privacy is by strengthening anonymity laws. I won't pretend like I know the answer to this complicated issue between the rights to privacy while maintaining the benefits these things offer. This being said, I think the first thing we need to be talking about is who uses it, and use cases. If we start the conversation there, the details will begin to come in to play.*

- How do we as an industry reassure the public of the truth behind our work, and gain their trust for when we recommend things be / not be regulated?

**My Answer:** *As I said previously, I think that probably the best way we can reassure the public of the truth behind our work is by having active members, startup owners and the likes, from within our own community speaking up; you're not going to be able to trust everybody, this is a given, but if we have good people who speak up and advocate for what is right from within our own community, the things we can bring to the table are incredible.*

- Where do we classify the difference between critical data that can be used, and overbearing data collection? For what cost-benefit of privacy?

**My Answer:** *One of the first things I think we need to realize here is that different industries are going to have different needs and requirements for different use cases - that's a given. Whereas Facebook doesn't need your social security number on file, a bank is required to. A better place to start talking about this might be, "How do we ensure only minimal data collection for required needs is collected by organizations and institutions, and non-essential data is clearly known to be optional, perhaps with use cases?"*

- What long term effects do you believe constitutional rights to privacy will have in terms of industry progression?

**My Answer:** *There's two ways to think about this. Some may see it as a barrier to industry progression, but I see it as a great opportunity to more-or-less weed out some of the potentially more threatening projects, businesses, etc and a way to try our best to keep a positive image in public eye - because of science fiction and the likes, people are afraid of our industry, and we need to maintain as positive of an image as possible so we don't see some sort of ethical winter or downfall.*
